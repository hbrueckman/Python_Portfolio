# Haley Brueckman's Portfolio
Hi and welcome to my portfolio! A little about me...I am an aspiring GIS analyst and am currently working on a GIS Certificate from the University of Montana. I have been teaching myself python with a focus on utilizing code to automate GIS tasks and make my work reproducible. Before working towards my GIS certificate, I completed a degree in Environmental Studies and have been working in the environmental field building trails and doing restoration work. I realized I wanted to continue my education further, and GIS seemed like a perfect fit for me. I have always enjoyed maps and thinking of the world in a spatial context, and GIS allows me to expolore these spatial connections that utlimately define our world. 

My portfolio includes code I wrote for an independent project where I challenged myself to complete a lab assignment from my Intro to GIS class utilizing only python.  

My portfolio demonstrates my ability to:

•	Utilize python libraries such as geopandas, shapely, numpy, and matplotlib
  
• Perform a spatial query


Although I am still learning python, I excited about the vast potential that it can offer to my GIS work. Learning python has helped me to better understand the backend processes that underlie GIS and to be more efficicent. I'm excited to continue developing this skill!

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
