# Haley Brueckman's Portfolio
Hi and welcome to my portfolio! A little about me...I am an aspiring GIS analyst and am currently working on a GIS Certificate from the University of Montana. I have been teaching myself python with a focus on utilizing code to automate GIS tasks and make my work reproducible. Before working towards my GIS certificate, I completed a degree in Environmental Studies and have been working in the environmental field building trails and doing restoration work. I realized I wanted to continue my education further, and GIS seemed like a perfect fit for me. I have always enjoyed maps and thinking of the world in a spatial context, and GIS allows me to expolore these spatial connections that utlimately define our world. 

My portfolio includes code I written for assingments from the class Automating GIS Processes out of the Univeristy of Helsinki (2019 version) I also included code from an independent project where I challenged myself to complete a lab assignemtn from my Intro to GIS class utilizing only python. 

My portfolio demonstrates my ability to:

•	Utilizing python libraries such as geopandas, shapely, numpy, and matplotlib
  
•Geocoding 

•	Plotting data 


Although I am still learning python, I excited about the vast potential that it can offer to my GIS work. Learning python has helped me to better understand the backend processes that underlie GIS and to be more efficicent. I'm excited to continue developing this skill!

Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
